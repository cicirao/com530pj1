        <p>I'm Xi Rao, an Information Architecture student at Illinois Institute of Technology. I've earned a bachelor's degree on Software Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology(HUST).</p>
        <p>I'm interested in information design, user experience research and photography. I came to Chicago in 2013, from Wuhan, China, pursuing my dream of becoming an Information Designer, which I believe I can make a reality in the United States. It’s hard as well as fun to face the conflicts of inter-cultural communication every day.</p>
        <p>An unforgettable experience in HUST changed my professional life. In September 2011, I joined a student group called “Dian group”. “Dian group” is lead by a female faculty in HUST, aiming at helping students get involved in real contract projects by cooperating with companies. In that group, I learned how to write a web page, how to cooperate with others as a team and how to work as a mobile product manager. Before that, I could just write C and some Java. And this place made me found a brand-new world.</p>
        <p>My first web page was born in my senior year, a recruiting website for “Dian Group”. Not friendly with IE6, but enough to be a web page. After that, I worked in a crawler system which fetched data from specific blogs and forums. That was the first time I used XML and regular-expressions. Then we founded an HTML5 club as a subdivision of Dian group in December, 2012. We’ve won several awards in HTML5 competitions. To make myself better and more competitive, I’m learning <strong>node.js</strong> and <strong>python</strong> now. Hopefully, I can build my own web application in the future all by myself.</p>
        <p>Anyway, during that whole time I interacted with web page and mobile apps. I gradually realized that all these things should be created for human-beings. No matter what kind of technology we use, we use it to make products for human-beings.</p>
        <p>Speaking of ambitions, I have two: The first is to redesign my portfolio page: <a href="http://xi-rao.me">xi-rao.me</a>. Since I’ve already made one and it got 18 errors in W3C HTML validator, it is necessary to refine my way of building a web page. The second is to learn appreciating others’ work. I wish I can always get inspired from others’ work. So that after this semester, I can keep going on with tremendous web pages in the world.</p>
